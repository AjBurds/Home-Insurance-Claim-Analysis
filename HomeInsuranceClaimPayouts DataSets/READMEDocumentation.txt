### SQL Data Analysis

To analyze the home insurance claim payouts data, SQL queries were written to summarize and explore the dataset. The key analyses performed are:

1. **Total Claim Amount by State:**
   - This query calculates the total claim amount for each state.
   - The results show which states have the highest and lowest total claim amounts.

2. **Average Claim Amount by Claim Type:**
   - This query calculates the average claim amount for each type of claim (e.g., Fire, Theft, Water Damage, Natural Disaster).
   - The results help identify which claim types generally have higher payouts.

3. **Count of Claims by Status:**
   - This query counts the number of claims for each status (Approved, Denied, Pending).
   - The results provide insight into the distribution of claim statuses.

#### SQL Queries

```sql
-- Total Claim Amount by State
SELECT state, SUM(CAST([Claim Amount] AS FLOAT)) AS total_claim_amount
FROM [dbo].[Home Insurance Claim Payout Dataset]
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY total_claim_amount DESC;

-- Average Claim Amount by Claim Type
SELECT [Claim Type], AVG(CAST([Claim Amount] AS FLOAT)) AS average_claim_amount
FROM [dbo].[Home Insurance Claim Payout Dataset]
GROUP BY [Claim Type]
ORDER BY average_claim_amount DESC;

-- Count of Claims by Status
SELECT [Claim Status], COUNT([Claim ID]) AS count_of_claims
FROM [dbo].[Home Insurance Claim Payout Dataset]
GROUP BY [Claim Status]
ORDER BY count_of_claims DESC;


Analyses provide valuable insights into the patterns and trends in home insurance claim payouts.
